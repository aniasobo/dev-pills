# Centering in CSS

```
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

`0` value -> puts no margin on top and bottom  

`auto` -> forces the browser to adjust sides so that content is centred  


**Must** be used with the `width` attribute added - not possible to center a div within an element that fills the page - it can only be centred relative to its width
