# Notes from intro to Redux

* Redux is a **state manager** that helps organize the flow of data in React applications in a predictable way
* The **Redux Store** is a single object that can represent all of the backing data for a React application
* **Actions** are objects that contain information that pass data around the Redux application
* Action creators construct action objects
* **Reducers** respond to actions and provide ways to update the store
* `React-Router` uses components like the `BrowserRouter`, `Switch`, and `Route` to set up endpoints on the application that link to specific components
