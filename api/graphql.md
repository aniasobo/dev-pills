## Servers

* [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source;  great as a stand-alone server, an addon to an existing Node.js HTTP server, or in "serverless" environments

## Frameworks

* [Getting started at building APIs with NestJS](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-a-secure-api-with-nestjs-getting-started/)
