# Negotiating strategy <!-- omit in toc -->

Based on _Getting to Yes_ by Roger Fisher & William Ury

## The Problem: _Don't Bargain Over Positions_ <!-- omit in toc -->
  - it creates overcommitment to a set position and defending it becomes a _saving face_ strategy; 
  - the more attention is paid to positions, the less attention is devoted to addressing the underlying concerns of the parties. 
  - Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement, and 
  - endangeres ongoing relationship by creating a contest of wills.
  - It's even harder to do when there are more than two parties.
  - Playing the soft game makes you vulnerable to someone who's playing a hard game of positional bargaining.
  - Alternative to the soft-hard game style: _principled negotiation_ or _negotiation on the merits_:

## The Solution: _Principled Negotiation_ or _Negotiation on the Merits_: <!-- omit in toc -->
- [Separate the People from the Problem](#separate-the-people-from-the-problem)
- [Focus on Interests Not Positions](#focus-on-interests-not-positions)
- [Invent Options for Mutual Gain](#invent-options-for-mutual-gain)
- [Insist on using Objective Criteria](#insist-on-using-objective-criteria)

### Three stages of _Principled Negotiation_:

1. **Analysis** - diagnose the situation, gather the people problems and partisan perceptions, identify interests of either side; note the options already on the table and the criteria already suggested as basis for agreement.
2. **Planning** - deal with the above once again, this time generating ideas and deciding what to do; generate additional options and criteria.
3. **Discussion** - communicate back and forth pursuing agreement, going through the 4 elements; each party should understand the position of another; jointly generate options and criteria
