# Negotiating strategy <!-- omit in toc -->

Based on _Getting to Yes_ by Roger Fisher & William Ury

## The Problem: _Don't Bargain Over Positions_ <!-- omit in toc -->
  - it creates overcommitment to a set position and defending it becomes a _saving face_ strategy; 
  - the more attention is paid to positions, the less attention is devoted to addressing the underlying concerns of the parties. 
  - Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement, and 
  - endangeres ongoing relationship by creating a contest of wills.
  - It's even harder to do when there are more than two parties.
  - Playing the soft game makes you vulnerable to someone who's playing a hard game of positional bargaining.
  - Alternative to the soft-hard game style: _principled negotiation_ or _negotiation on the merits_:

### Three stages of _Principled Negotiation_:

1. **Analysis** - diagnose the situation, gather the people problems and partisan perceptions, identify interests of either side; note the options already on the table and the criteria already suggested as basis for agreement.
2. **Planning** - deal with the above once again, this time generating ideas and deciding what to do; generate additional options and criteria.
3. **Discussion** - communicate back and forth pursuing agreement, going through the 4 elements; each party should understand the position of another; jointly generate options and criteria
   
## Separate the People from the Problem

* Working out an agreement creates a psychological commitment to a mutually satisfying outcome that can come useful in future negotiations.
* Every negotiatior has two types of interest: in the substance and in the relationship.
* The relationship tends to get entangled with the problem. 
* Positional bargaining puts both substance and relationship in conflict.
* Base the relationship on mutually understood perceptions, clear two-way communication, and forward-looking, problem-solving outlook.
* Deal with people problems not by trying to solve them with substantive concessions but by treating people differently.
* Where perceptions differ, look to test assumptions.
* Use psychological techniques to solve people problems.
* Pay attention to _core concerns_ - trampling on those may generate strong negative emotions; attending to them builds rapport and a positive atmosphere for problem-solving.
* Don't threathen the other party's identity.
* Let the other party vent their frustrations and emotions.
* Listen actively, acknowledge what has been said to improve communication and avoid misinterpretation.
* Best time for handling people problems is before they appear: structure the negotiation so that the substance is disentangled from the relationship and people's egos.


## Focus on Interests Not Positions

* For a wise solution, reconcile interests, not positions.
* Interests - desires and concerns that motivate people - not positions, define the problem.
* > Your position is something you've decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide.
* For every reason, several positions exist that could satisfy it; people tend to adopt the most obvious one.
* Behind opposing positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.
* Getting to the interests behind the positions - question _why?_ and _why not?_; realise that each side has multiple interests.
* Basic human needs are the most powerful interests; these are: 
  * security
  * economic well-being
  * sense of belonging
  * recognition
  * control over one's life
* Explain your interests well: 
  * give examples
  * make them come alive
  * be specific
  * establish their legitimacy
  * acknowledge their interests as part of the problem
  * present the problem before presenting the solution


## Invent Options for Mutual Gain

* Having more options is not always good.

### Four major obstacles that prevent the creation of multiple options: <!-- omit in toc -->

1. **Premature judgement**
     - inventing options does not come naturally
     - judgement hinders imagination
     - fear of disclosing information that will jeopardise your position
2. **Searching for the single answer**
     - seeing your job as negotiator as to narrow down the amount of options, not expand it
     - fear of pettyfogging the process
     - understanding the desired outcome as a single solution
     - risks premature closure that ignores better multiple solutions
3. **The assumption of a fixed pie**
     - seeing the dispute as an either/or fixed sum game
4. **Thinking that "solving the problem is their problem"**
     - each side is concerned only with its immediate interest
     - psychological reluctance to accord any legitimacy to the other side
     - fear of appearing "disloyal"

### How to invent creative options <!-- omit in toc -->

1. **Separate inventing from deciding**
   - separate the creative act from the critical act so that the former is not hindered by the latter
   - invent first, decide later
   - [brainstorm session](#how-to-conduct-brainstorming-sessions) where parties are told to ignore the feasibility of conjured solutions
2. **Consider brainstorming with the other side**
   - might be done on the record
   - creates an atmosphere of joint problem-solving
3. **Broaden your options**
   - room to negotiate can only be made with an abundance of options
   - multiply the options by shuffling between the specific and the general (_The Circle Chart_)
   - look at the problem through the eyes of different experts (in different disciplines)
   - invent provisional and "weak" agreements, find what all parties agree to disagree on; weaker solutions can be: procedural, provisional, partial, in principle, contingent, non-binding; strong agreements are characterised by being: substantive, permanent, comprehensive, final, unconditional, binding
   - change the scope of the problem, fraction it
   - find ways to sweaten a weak deal
4. **Look for mutual gain**
   - try to satisfy each side with a creative solution or begin the development of a relationship that will be mutually advantegous 
   - identify shared interests early on
   - shared interests are rarely immediately obvious
   - shared interests are opportunities but they're worthless if not acted upon; formulate them as goals, future-orient them
   - stating the shared interests makes the negotiations run more smoothly
5. **Look for the differing interests**
   - agreement comes from identifying the areas of disagreement
   - a difference of beliefs might require an outside arbiter
   - different value might be placed on time
   - difference in forecasting might lead you to identifying criteria
   - differences in risk aversion - what can be done to offset those
6. **Ask for their preferences**
   - one strategy is to present a selection of options that are equally acceptable to you    
   - this will let you know what's preferable, not necessarily what's acceptable
   - work more on the chosen/preferred option
   - iterative improvement of the option
7. Other considerations:
   - look for solutions that are low-cost for you, high-gain for them
8. **Make their decision easy**
   - focus on one person from the opposing party when trying to "put yourself in their shoes"
   - find solutions that are easy to implement even if they don't get them all they want
   - it can be easier to refrain from action rather than stopping something that's underway
   - it can be easier to cease doing something rather than actioning something
   - come up with a solution that appears legitimate: fair, legal, honourable etc
   - find a precedent - propose a similar solution; this works on the desire to be consistent  


## Insist on using Objective Criteria

* trying to reconcile differences on the basis of will is constly
* preferable to base the negotiation not on individual wills but on objective criteria
* focus on the merits of the problem, not feelings of either party
* agreement consistent with precedent is less vulnerable to attack
* look for independent standards - market rates, industry practice, regulations, fair standards, efficiency, cost, scientific way of evaluating impact, scientific model etc
* ideally, objective criteria should apply to both sides
* > classic cake dividing method: one person cuts, the other person chooses their slice
* application of the above: both parties agree on a fair arrangement before choosing their roles within it

# Troubleshooting difficult negotiations <!-- omit in toc -->

## What if they are more powerful? <!-- omit in toc -->

**Develop your BATNA - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement**

* sometimes your position will be significantly weaker and no amount of skillfull negotiation strategy will give you leverage
* **Protect yourself** 
    - don't end up too accomodating
    - establish the worst acceptable outcome - the bottom line
    - be mindful that having a bottom line makes you rigid and closes you off to creative solutions
    - be mindful that a bottom line is likely to be set too high
* **Enter BATNA**
    - BATNA is the alternative to the bottom line
    - the better your BATNA, the greater your power - the relative negotiating power lies in how attractive to each the option of not reaching an agreement is
* judge every offer against the BATNA
* disclosing: if your BATNA is very attractive, disclose
* never disclose if your BATNA is likely worse than they think
* consider the other party's BATNA - try to find out their alternatives, think if you can present them as unrealistic

### Generating BATNA: <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Make a list of actions you could feasibly take if no agreement is reached.
2. Improve the more promising ideas and convert them into practical alternatives.
3. Tentatively select the best of the alternatives.


## What if they won't play? <!-- omit in toc -->

* change the game by initiating the play on merit, or
* counter the positional bargaining moves - this is called the _negotiation jitsu_
* third approach: _third party mediation_

### Use _Negotiation Jitsu_  <!-- omit in toc -->

* do not push back
* do not reject their position
* do not defend your ideas when the other party attacks them
* step aside and use your strength to: explore common interests, invent options of mutual gain and find independent standards

**Diffusing the three most common attacks with _Negotiation Jitsu_**

* most common attack maneuvers are: asserting a forceful position, attacking your ideas and attacking you
      
1. Don't attack their position - look behind it
    - treat their position as one possible option
    - ask them how they think their proposition addresses the problem at hand
    - discuss the principles underlying their position
    - discuss hypotheticals of accepting their position
2. Don't defend your ideas - invite criticism and advice
    - ask them to specify what is wrong with your idea
    - find interests underlying their negative judgements
    - rework your ideas so that they address those interests
    - turn the situation around and ask their advice for addressing your interests
3. Reframe the attack on you as an attack on the problem
    - allow them to vent by attacking you
    - don't defend yourself
    - express your understanding while reframing what's been said into an attack on the problem
4. Use the Negotiation Jitsu tools:
    - use quesions instead of statements
    - use silence as a weapon: if the answer to your question is insufficient, sit back and wait for them to fill the silence
    - use silence after you ask the question - don't fall into temptation to specify, rephrase or narrow down your question in order to fill the silence

### The one-text procedure <!-- omit in toc -->

* the one-text procedure involves getting a third party to mediate
* the mediator asks each party about their interests, not their position; the mediator makes a list of those and the list gets critiqued by each party
* the list is finalised and presented to each party for a yes or no decision
* you don't need either party's consent to act as a mediator - simply start combining their interests into a list and seek criticism from both

### Getting them to play <!-- omit in toc -->

**"_Please correct me if I'm wrong_"** - present your analysis; establish dialogue based on reason; open yourself up to correction.

**"_We appreciate what you've done for us._"** - defuse any threats to their self-image; disentangle poeple from the problem at hand; imply that the person will continue to provide the support you're grateful for. 

**"_Our concern is fairness._"** - express intention to stick to principle; express being open to persuasion along the lines of this principle.  

**"_We would like to settle this on the basis of independent standards, not of who can do what to whom._"** - if the other party tries to pull the discussion back to positioned bargaining, let them vent, then reaffirm your commitment to principled bargaining.  

**"_Trust is a separate issue._"** - direct the discussion back to the principle; it would be poor strategy to acknowledge lack of trust on either side. 

**"_Could I ask you a few questions to see whether my facts are right?_"** - ask questions instead of stating facts to seem less threathening; less provocative method of communicating; creating a foundation of agreed-upon facts helps find principles on which the solution can be built. 

**"_What's the principle behind your action?_"** - neither accept nor reject the other party's position; assumes their reasons are good.

**"_Let me see if I understand what you're saying._"** - once the other party feels understood, they can relax and negotiate on principle; the other party can't dismiss your arguments on the basis that you don't understand their position; establishes a cooperative game. 

**"_Let me get back to you._"** - it's hard to make a good decision on the spot; agree to resume the discussion at a given point; consult your constituency; too much time at the negotiation table might weaken your principled stance - take a break when you see that on the horizon, and return with a renewed resolve.

**"_Let me show you where I have trouble following some of your reasoning._"** - you present your reasons first before offering a proposal - otherwise your principles might seem like a justification.

**"_One fair solution might be..._"** - present the proposal not as yours, but as one of several fair solutions; not the only fair solution - you're open to their interpretations of fairness.

**"_If we agree... If we disagree..._"** - make it sound convenient to agree sooner rather than later; express your reluctance to the pessimistic scenario; make the solution sound like a joint gain, convenient to both sides; come up with a solution that lets the other party save face.

**_"It's been a pleasure dealing with you."_** - end the negotiation on a concilliatory note; neither party will be tempted to sabotage the agreement; a working relationship is maintained for the future.
     
## What if they use dirty tricks? <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Recognise the fact that the other side is being deceptive.
2. Raise the issue explicitly.
3. Question the desireability of this tactic and negotiate over it.

### Common dirty tactics <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Deliberate deception:
   - phony facts
   - ambiguous authority
   - dubious intentions
   - less than full disclosure (not a form of deception)
2. Psychological warfare
   - tactics designed to make you uncomfortable
   - conducting the negotiation in a stressful environment
   - ad hominem attacks
   - the good cop/bad cop routine
   - threats
3. Positional pressure tactics
   - refusal to negotiate
   - extreme demands
   - escalating demands
   - lock-in tactics
   - having a hardhearter partner who would not agree to your proposal
   - calculated delay
   - "Take it or leave it."
