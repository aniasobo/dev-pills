# Negotiating strategy <!-- omit in toc -->

Based on _Getting to Yes_ by Roger Fisher & William Ury

## The Problem: _Don't Bargain Over Positions_ <!-- omit in toc -->
  - it creates overcommitment to a set position and defending it becomes a _saving face_ strategy; 
  - the more attention is paid to positions, the less attention is devoted to addressing the underlying concerns of the parties. 
  - Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement, and 
  - endangeres ongoing relationship by creating a contest of wills.
  - It's even harder to do when there are more than two parties.
  - Playing the soft game makes you vulnerable to someone who's playing a hard game of positional bargaining.
  - Alternative to the soft-hard game style: _principled negotiation_ or _negotiation on the merits_:

### Three stages of _Principled Negotiation_:

1. **Analysis** - diagnose the situation, gather the people problems and partisan perceptions, identify interests of either side; note the options already on the table and the criteria already suggested as basis for agreement.
2. **Planning** - deal with the above once again, this time generating ideas and deciding what to do; generate additional options and criteria.
3. **Discussion** - communicate back and forth pursuing agreement, going through the 4 elements; each party should understand the position of another; jointly generate options and criteria
   
## Separate the People from the Problem

* Working out an agreement creates a psychological commitment to a mutually satisfying outcome that can come useful in future negotiations.
* Every negotiatior has two types of interest: in the substance and in the relationship.
* The relationship tends to get entangled with the problem. 
* Positional bargaining puts both substance and relationship in conflict.
* Base the relationship on mutually understood perceptions, clear two-way communication, and forward-looking, problem-solving outlook.
* Deal with people problems not by trying to solve them with substantive concessions but by treating people differently.
* Where perceptions differ, look to test assumptions.
* Use psychological techniques to solve people problems.
* Pay attention to _core concerns_ - trampling on those may generate strong negative emotions; attending to them builds rapport and a positive atmosphere for problem-solving.
* Don't threathen the other party's identity.
* Let the other party vent their frustrations and emotions.
* Listen actively, acknowledge what has been said to improve communication and avoid misinterpretation.
* Best time for handling people problems is before they appear: structure the negotiation so that the substance is disentangled from the relationship and people's egos.


## Focus on Interests Not Positions

* For a wise solution, reconcile interests, not positions.
* Interests - desires and concerns that motivate people - not positions, define the problem.
* > Your position is something you've decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide.
* For every reason, several positions exist that could satisfy it; people tend to adopt the most obvious one.
* Behind opposing positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.
* Getting to the interests behind the positions - question _why?_ and _why not?_; realise that each side has multiple interests.
* Basic human needs are the most powerful interests; these are: 
  * security
  * economic well-being
  * sense of belonging
  * recognition
  * control over one's life
* Explain your interests well: 
  * give examples
  * make them come alive
  * be specific
  * establish their legitimacy
  * acknowledge their interests as part of the problem
  * present the problem before presenting the solution
