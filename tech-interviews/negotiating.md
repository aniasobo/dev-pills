# Negotiating strategy <!-- omit in toc -->

Based on _Getting to Yes_ by Roger Fisher & William Ury

## The Problem: _Don't Bargain Over Positions_ <!-- omit in toc -->
  - it creates overcommitment to a set position and defending it becomes a _saving face_ strategy; 
  - the more attention is paid to positions, the less attention is devoted to addressing the underlying concerns of the parties. 
  - Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement, and 
  - endangeres ongoing relationship by creating a contest of wills.
  - It's even harder to do when there are more than two parties.
  - Playing the soft game makes you vulnerable to someone who's playing a hard game of positional bargaining.
  - Alternative to the soft-hard game style: _principled negotiation_ or _negotiation on the merits_:

### Three stages of _Principled Negotiation_:

1. **Analysis** - diagnose the situation, gather the people problems and partisan perceptions, identify interests of either side; note the options already on the table and the criteria already suggested as basis for agreement.
2. **Planning** - deal with the above once again, this time generating ideas and deciding what to do; generate additional options and criteria.
3. **Discussion** - communicate back and forth pursuing agreement, going through the 4 elements; each party should understand the position of another; jointly generate options and criteria
   
## Separate the People from the Problem

* Working out an agreement creates a psychological commitment to a mutually satisfying outcome that can come useful in future negotiations.
* Every negotiatior has two types of interest: in the substance and in the relationship.
* The relationship tends to get entangled with the problem. 
* Positional bargaining puts both substance and relationship in conflict.
* Base the relationship on mutually understood perceptions, clear two-way communication, and forward-looking, problem-solving outlook.
* Deal with people problems not by trying to solve them with substantive concessions but by treating people differently.
* Where perceptions differ, look to test assumptions.
* Use psychological techniques to solve people problems.
* Pay attention to _core concerns_ - trampling on those may generate strong negative emotions; attending to them builds rapport and a positive atmosphere for problem-solving.
* Don't threathen the other party's identity.
* Let the other party vent their frustrations and emotions.
* Listen actively, acknowledge what has been said to improve communication and avoid misinterpretation.
* Best time for handling people problems is before they appear: structure the negotiation so that the substance is disentangled from the relationship and people's egos.


## Focus on Interests Not Positions

* For a wise solution, reconcile interests, not positions.
* Interests - desires and concerns that motivate people - not positions, define the problem.
* > Your position is something you've decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide.
* For every reason, several positions exist that could satisfy it; people tend to adopt the most obvious one.
* Behind opposing positions lie shared and compatible interests, as well as conflicting ones.
* Getting to the interests behind the positions - question _why?_ and _why not?_; realise that each side has multiple interests.
* Basic human needs are the most powerful interests; these are: 
  * security
  * economic well-being
  * sense of belonging
  * recognition
  * control over one's life
* Explain your interests well: 
  * give examples
  * make them come alive
  * be specific
  * establish their legitimacy
  * acknowledge their interests as part of the problem
  * present the problem before presenting the solution


## Invent Options for Mutual Gain

* Having more options is not always good.

**Four major obstacles that prevent the creation of multiple options:**

1. **Premature judgement**
  - inventing options does not come naturally
  - judgement hinders imagination
  - fear of disclosing information that will jeopardise your position
2. **Searching for the single answer**
  - seeing your job as negotiator as to narrow down the amount of options, not expand it
  - fear of pettyfogging the process
  - understanding the desired outcome as a single solution
  - risks premature closure that ignores better multiple solutions
3. **The assumption of a fixed pie**
  - seeing the dispute as an either/or fixed sum game
4. **Thinking that "solving the problem is their problem"**
  - each side is concerned only with its immediate interest
  - psychological reluctance to accord any legitimacy to the other side
  - fear of appearing "disloyal"

**How to invent creative options**

1. **Separate inventing from deciding**
   - separate the creative act from the critical act so that the former is not hindered by the latter
   - invent first, decide later
   - [brainstorm session](#how-to-conduct-brainstorming-sessions) where parties are told to ignore the feasibility of conjured solutions
2. **Consider brainstorming with the other side**
   - might be done on the record
   - creates an atmosphere of joint problem-solving
3. **Broaden your options**
   - room to negotiate can only be made with an abundance of options
   - multiply the options by shuffling between the specific and the general (_The Circle Chart_)
   - look at the problem through the eyes of different experts (in different disciplines)
   - invent provisional and "weak" agreements, find what all parties agree to disagree on; weaker solutions can be: procedural, provisional, partial, in principle, contingent, non-binding; strong agreements are characterised by being: substantive, permanent, comprehensive, final, unconditional, binding
   - change the scope of the problem, fraction it
   - find ways to sweaten a weak deal
4. **Look for mutual gain**
   - try to satisfy each side with a creative solution or begin the development of a relationship that will be mutually advantegous 
   - identify shared interests early on
   - shared interests are rarely immediately obvious
   - shared interests are opportunities but they're worthless if not acted upon; formulate them as goals, future-orient them
   - stating the shared interests makes the negotiations run more smoothly
5. **Look for the differing interests**
   - agreement comes from identifying the areas of disagreement
   - a difference of beliefs might require an outside arbiter
   - different value might be placed on time
   - difference in forecasting might lead you to identifying criteria
   - differences in risk aversion - what can be done to offset those
6. **Ask for their preferences**
   - one strategy is to present a selection of options that are equally acceptable to you    
   - this will let you know what's preferable, not necessarily what's acceptable
   - work more on the chosen/preferred option
   - iterative improvement of the option
7. Other considerations:
   - look for solutions that are low-cost for you, high-gain for them
8. **Make their decision easy**
   - focus on one person from the opposing party when trying to "put yourself in their shoes"
   - find solutions that are easy to implement even if they don't get them all they want
   - it can be easier to refrain from action rather than stopping something that's underway
   - it can be easier to cease doing something rather than actioning something
   - come up with a solution that appears legitimate: fair, legal, honourable etc
   - find a precedent - propose a similar solution; this works on the desire to be consistent

## How to conduct brainstorming sessions <!-- omit in toc -->

### Before brainstorming <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Define your purpose.
2. Choose a few participants.
3. Change the environment.
4. Desing an informal atmosphere.
5. Choose a facilitator.

### During brainstorming <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Seat the participants side by side facing the problem.
2. Clarify the ground rules, including the no-criticism rule.
3. Brainstorm.
4. Record the ideas in full view.

### After brainstorming <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Star the most promising ideas (start relaxing the no-criticism rule).
2. Invent improvements for promising ideas.
3. Set up a time frame for evaluating the ideas and deciding which ones to advance to the negotiation.
