# Tech interviews workshop notes

### 1. Take-home tech test

* must be completed to deadline
* you must TDD
* explain your process in your README
* be prepared to discuss/expand during interview
* submit MVP (incomplete work unlikely to be successful)
* make sure you don't add extras that are not in the spec before the MVP


### 2. Pair programming during a tech test

* ask clarifying questions
* talk through your process
* diagram solutions
* figure out the roles
* use the partner to unblock yourself

### 3. Past projects

* you __will__ be asked about your final project, the code, the teamwork etc so know it really well
* be able to sketch/diagram its architecture
* explain what each bit of code does
* possible next steps in the project
* your favourite personal projects - in detail

### 4. Chit-chat

* high-level stuff like: 'How does the Internet work?'
* trivia like: 'What is the difference between a class and a module?'
* process: 'Is TDD always good?' or 'Explain Agile'
