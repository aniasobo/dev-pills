## Tech interviews workshop notes

- submit MVP (incomplete work unlikely to be successful)
- make sure you don't add extras not in the spec before the MVP
- explain your process in your README
- find examples online: Just Eat engineering test
- ask a lot of questions at the beginning 
- you will be asked:
	* to explain coding decisions
	* next steps in the project
	* how you'd improve the API used in test
	* how you'd track down performance issues
	* your favourite feature of your chosen language and example usage
	* your favourite personal projects - in detail
	* you __will__ be asked about your final project, the code, the teamwork etc so know it really well

#### Pair programming during a tech test

* diagram solutions
* explain your process
* ask clarifying questions
* figure out the roles
* use the partner to unblock yourself
