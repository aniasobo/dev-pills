## Tech test checklist

Tech test checklist from Makers Academy

- [ ] Is your code [properly tested](#testing-checklist)?

- [ ] Does your repository have a [good README](#readme-checklist)?

- [ ] Re-read the original task and check you've fulfilled all the requirements.

- [ ] Is your code formatted idiomatically?

- [ ] Does your code look correctly formatted on GitHub as well as on your computer?

- [ ] Have you taken as much logic as possible **out of your controllers** into models/libraries?

- [ ] Have you taken logic **out of your views**?

- [ ] Does your code follow the **Single Responsibility Principle**? Ask each class, spec and method/function what it does, if the reply involves the word "and" you probably need to refactor.

- [ ] Are the units well encapsulated?

- [ ] Have you kept your **methods/classes as small as possible**?

- [ ] Have you run your code through a linter?

- [ ] Do all your **names make sense**? Can someone else understand what's going on without you having to explain it to them? Do your names use the language of the problem domain?

- [ ] Is any of your code doing anything **unusual/suprising**?

- [ ] Have you removed all comments except those that are absolutely necessary?

### Testing checklist

- [ ] Is all your code **tested** (especially unit tests but also feature tests where appropriate)?

- [ ] Are your tests passing?

- [ ] Do you have high test coverage?

- [ ] Have you tested unhappy paths and edge cases?

- [ ] Do your unit tests mock their collaborators?

- [ ] Do you always test for behaviour, rather than state?

- [ ] Do your specs **read well** when you run them?

### README checklist

- [ ] Describe how you approached designing your solution to the problem.

- [ ] Describe how you structured your code.  Why did you do it this way?

- [ ] Describe how to install and run your code and tests.

- [ ] Describe the dependencies your code has.  What trade-offs did you make when deciding what dependencies to use?

- [ ] If you've deployed the app, include a link to it.

- [ ] Include screenshots of your running app.

- [ ] Try very hard to complete all the tasks in the tech test.  If you run out of time, outline how you would have approached the sections you didn't get to.

- [ ] Describe the extensions you would add if you had more time.

- [ ] Spelling and grammar.
