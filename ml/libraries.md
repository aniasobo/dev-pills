# Libraries for deep learning/ML

- [Keras - the python deep learning library](https://keras.io/) (can run on TensorFlow)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (_"better for fast moving research/learning"_)
- [FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) - Linux only, works with PyTorch
- > PyTorch and FastAI are deeply connected—you can’t become really proficient at using fastai if you don’t know PyTorch well, too - [Source](https://course.fast.ai/)
