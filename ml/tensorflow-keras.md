# Tensorflow 2.0 with Keras

[Notes from A Practical Guide to Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras](https://github.com/Vadikus/practicalDL)

### Jupyter

- runs with `$ jupyter notebook .` in your proj directory
- local server, runs the notebook on port `8888` by default
- runs a python interpreter
- notebooks are in markdown and can be browser-edited
- tensorflow functions can be executed in them too
- run shell commands in Jupyter by prepending them with a bang, like `!pip install bla`
