**Examples** are in Cucumber format: Given - When - Then

**Questions** are added by team members during the session, stuck around the closest rule that applies, or on the side

**Rules** are often extracted from the Questions, or the Questions contribute to identification of new Rules and more Examples

## 🎨 Colour coding:

- YELLOW for the feature/user story
- RED for questions
- BLUE for rules
- GREEN for examples

## What is it?

- EM is essentially specifying acceptance criteria
- helps to have designs to illustrate potential problems
- questions are good for tech challenges and clarifications
